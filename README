-Downgraded Snd from 8.4/26.9 back to 8.4/12.9 again. That upgrade was a mindless mistake.
-Copied all files from my private snd three into snd-ls. Hopefully, this should make everything
 work again.
-Added fix to make jackdmp work with standard installation of guile.


0.9.7.7 -> 0.9.7.10

 help menu along with the "c" key for turning on/off controls.


0.9.5.5 -> 0.9.6.0_beta
-Updated Snd from 7.15 to 8.0.
-Enabled rt-player by default. rt-player is an alternative player engine
 for snd, that plays using the rt-extension and reads data from disk through
 a ringbuffer. The result is less clicks.


0.9.5.4 -> 0.9.5.5
-Reenabled code in the configure script to check for liblrdf. Thanks to 
 Andres Cabrera for pointing this out.
-Simplifed the ladspa stuff. It now works with guile 1.8, use a lot less
 time to start, and more than one instance of the same ladspa plugin can
 be run at once.

-Print debug info to stdout when something goes wrong in a hook or timed
 callback.
-Backported Bill's fix for segfaulting when changing filter order when
 playing. Bug found by Tim Blechman.
(-The included diff-file between SND v7.15 vs. SND-ls is now 108000 bytes. Probably time
  to move on to SND v7.20.)


0.9.5.3 -> 0.9.5.4
-Changed default resampling quality to SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY
-Added workaround for shift-handling across various keyboard settings.
 (zoom in and undo should work with american keyboards now.)
